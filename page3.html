        <b>History and Origin</b> The baguette is a long, thin loaf of French
        bread known for its crispy crust and soft interior. Its origins can be
        traced back to the late 19th century in France. The word "baguette"
        means "wand" or "baton" in French, reflecting its shape.<br />
        <br />

        <b>Characteristics</b>
        A traditional baguette is made from a lean dough of flour, water, yeast,
        and salt. It is characterized by its length (usually around 65 cm), its
        crisp, golden-brown crust, and its soft, airy crumb. The baking process
        involves high temperatures and steam, which help create the baguette's
        distinctive texture.<br />
        <br />
        <b>Cultural Significance</b>
        In France, the baguette is more than just bread; it is a cultural
        symbol. The French consume it daily, often fresh from the bakery. It is
        commonly used in sandwiches, served with cheese, or simply enjoyed with
        butter. The baguette has also gained international popularity,
        symbolizing French culinary excellence.
